# Is a Career in Data Right For You? A Comprehensive Guide

Picture this. You work at a massive company making buko bucks and you're the guy everyone comes to when they need to make an important decision. The most recent question you've been asked is if the company should invest a ton of money into a new product or not. What would you do?

How about if you were working at a pizza place instead and you and your co-workers notice that at specific times of the day, days of the week, or holidays, that it seems to get a whole lot busier and there aren't enough employees to handle the volume. What would you do?

This is where data becomes your best friend.

In the first example, you might start first by researching. What is this product? What's the price? Who sells it? Are they reputable? Maybe you find yourself asking questions that are more company facing. Do you have capacity for it? Would it help your companies trajectory? Maybe you find another person to bounce some of those questions off of that could help you gain more insights. 

In the second example, maybe you start counting how many customers came in at certain times, days, and seemingly outlier events. You notice that not many people come in for pizza in the morning, but they sure do on friday evening. You bring this to your boss, present and argument for more staff and show them what you've compilled. That would be a pretty convincing argument.

In both of these cases, data was gathered. Sometimes its just intentional information sought after and other times its gathered, visualized, and drives actionable insights. Either way, its incredible useful and a lot more insightful than the alternative.
